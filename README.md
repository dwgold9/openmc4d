openmc4d is a custom research fork of [OpenMC](https://github.com/openmc-dev/openmc) that extends the Monte Carlo particle transport framework into an additional temporal dimension. It is designed for time-structured neutronics (TSN) studies, where reactor systems alternate between distinct subcritical configurations in time.

## Key Features

- **4D Geometry Surfaces**  
  New time-dependent surfaces (e.g., `TPlane`) for defining regions and material boundaries that evolve in time.  

- **Dynamic Material and Operator Support**  
  Ability to modulate material properties, cross sections, and source terms over specified temporal intervals.  

- **Floquet / Periodic Analyses**  
  Tools for evaluating reactivity gain, Î±-eigenvalues, and mode structures in systems under periodic modulation.  

- **Python and YAML Interface**  
  Python bindings and YAML-driven inputs extend existing OpenMC workflows for defining 4D problems reproducibly.  

- **Backward Compatibility**  
  Standard 3D OpenMC simulations remain supported, with 4D functionality activated via the `OPENMC_ENABLE_4D` build option.  

## Research Applications

- Proof-of-principle studies in time-structured reactor design 
- Investigation of reactivity boosts in depleted-uranium / heavy-water systems  
- Exploration of dynamic isotope tailoring and spectral shaping  
- Modeling of conceptual designs such as Floquet microreactors
